1. Description
	The source code vm.c acts as a virtual machine for the PM/0 Instruction Set Architecture

2. Compiling
	You will need a C compiler (gcc preferred) on a UNIX system or UNIX bash terminal (such as Ubuntu). This program takes the input file as a command line argument and must be a text file (.txt extension preferred).

	To compile and run the virtual machine type the following commands in your UNIX terminal:

			$ gcc vm.c
			$ ./a.out file_name.txt

	**IMPORTANT**
	Be sure to replace "file_name" with the name of the instruction input file you wish to run.
